Code a program where a set of jobs need to be ordered and scheduled by its corelated importance without any clashes.

input:
  - a set of jobs, each one of them with 5 parameters;
  - parameters: start time; end time; weight (importance); interdependencies;
example:
  - job: 2;
  - start time: 2;
  - end time: 4;
  - weight: 4;
  - interdependencies: job 5;
interpretation:
  - job 2 starts at 2 and ends at 4;
  - job 2 importance level is 4;
  - job 2 cannot happen without job 5;
output:
  - job 3, job 4, job 5;
  - the output must be a schedule of jobs;
constraints:
  - jobs must not clash;
