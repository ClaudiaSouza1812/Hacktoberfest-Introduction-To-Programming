6. Now, it's time to make your contribution by editing a file that you are supposed to edit (depending on the section you are on). For practice, go over to ***CONTRIBUTORS.md*** and add your name following this format:

    ```markdown
    #### [Your Name](GitHub Link)
    - Place: City, State, Country
    - Bio: Who are you? (Just a one-liner)
    - Twitter: [Twitter Name](Twitter Link)
    ```

    The last one (Twitter) is optional and feel free to add any socials.

    *Tip: To edit a file, press the pencil next to its name.*

7. Press the green **Commit Changes** button on your top right.

    Here are some rules to follow to write a good commit message.

    - Start your message with a capital letter
    - Do not end the message with a period
    - Limit the message to 50 characters
    - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    - Keep your messages short and sweet
    - If you need to explain further make use of the description box

9. After committing your changes, click on the repository name to go back to the main page.

    *Your name mustn't match **update-readme** that's just an example. If Step 11 confuses you, just skip it, most likely your branches match anyway.*

12. Create your pull request by clicking on the green button.
